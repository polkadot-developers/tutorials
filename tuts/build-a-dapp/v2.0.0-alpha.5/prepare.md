## Install the Node Template

You should already have version `v2.0.0-alpha.5` of the
[Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
compiled on your computer from when you completed the
[Creating Your First Substrate Chain Tutorial](tutorials/creating-your-first-substrate-chain/index.md).
If you do not, please complete that tutorial.

> Experienced developers who truly prefer to skip that tutorial, you may install the node template
> according to the instructions in its readme.

## Install the Front End Template

This tutorial also uses a ReactJS front end template, which we will modify for interacting with our
custom Substrate blockchain. You can use this same template to create front-ends for your own
projects in the future.

To use the front-end template, you need [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), which itself requires
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you don't have these tools, you may install them from these
instructions:

- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

Now you can proceed to set up the front-end template with these commands.

```bash
# Clone the code from github
git clone -b v2.0.0-alpha.5 https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template

# Install the dependencies
cd substrate-front-end-template
yarn install
```

## About Proof of Existence

The dApp we will build is a Proof of Existence service. From
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence):

> Proof of Existence is an online service that verifies the existence of computer files as of a
> specific time via timestamped transactions in the bitcoin blockchain.

Rather than uploading the entire file to the blockchain to "prove its existence", users submit a
[hash of the file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_verification), known as a file digest or
checksum. These hashes are powerful because huge files can be uniquely represented by a small hash
value, which is efficient for storing on the blockchain. Any user with the original file can prove
that this file matches the one on the blockchain by simply recomputing the hash of the file and
comparing it with the hash stored on chain.

To add to this, blockchains also provide a robust identity system. So when a file digest is stored
on the blockchain, we can also record which user uploaded that digest. This allows that user to
later prove that they were the original person to claim the file.

Our Proof of Existence pallet will expose two callable functions:

- `create_claim` - allows a user to claim the existence of a file by uploading a file digest.
- `revoke_claim` - allows the current owner of a claim to revoke their ownership.

We will only need to store information about the proofs that have been claimed, and who made those
claims.

Sounds simple enough? Great, let's get coding.
