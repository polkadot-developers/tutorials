title: Launch Your Private Network
---

With you custom chain spec created and distributed to all participants, you're ready to launch your
own custom chain. In this section it is no longer required to use a single physical machine or a
single binary.

## First Participant Starts a Bootnode

You've completed all the necessary prep work and you're now ready to launch your chain. This process
is very similar to when you launched a chain earlier as Alice and Bob. It's important to start with
a clean base path, so if you plan to use the same path that you've used previously, please delete
all contents from that directory.

The first participant can launch her node with

```bash
./target/release/node-template \
  --base-path /tmp/node01 \
  --chain=./customSpecRaw.json \
  --port 30333 \
  --ws-port 9944 \
  --rpc-port 9933 \
  --telemetry-url 'ws://telemetry.polkadot.io:1024 0' \
  --validator \
  --name MyNode01
```

Here are some differences from when we launched as Alice.

- I've omitted the `--alice` flag. Instead we will insert our own custom keys into the keystore
  through the RPC shortly.
- The `--chain` flag has changed to use our custom chain spec.
- I've added the optional `--name` flag. You may use it to give your node a human-readable name in
  the telemetry UI.

You should see the console outputs something as follows:

## Add Keys to Keystore

Once your node is running, you will again notice that no blocks are being produced. At this point,
you need to add your keys into the keystore. Remember you will need to complete these steps for each
node in your network.

### Option 1: Using Polkadot-JS App UI

You can use the Apps UI to insert your keys into the keystore. Navigate to the "Toolbox" tab and the
"RPC Call" sub-tab. Choose "author" and "insertKey". The fields can be filled like this:

![Inserting a Aura key using Apps](../assets/private-network-apps-insert-key-aura.png)

```
keytype: aura
suri: <your mnemonic phrase> (eg. clip organ olive upper oak void inject side suit toilet stick narrow)
publicKey: <your raw sr25519 key> (eg. 0x9effc1668ca381c242885516ec9fa2b19c67b6684c02a8a3237b6862e5c8cd7e)
```

> If you generated your keys with the Apps UI you will not know your raw public key. In this case
> you may use your SS58 address (`5FfBQ3kwXrbdyoqLPvcXRp7ikWydXawpNs2Ceu3WwFdhZ8W4`) instead.

You've now successfully inserted your **aura** key. You can repeat those steps to insert your
**grandpa** key (the **ed25519** key)

![Inserting a Grandpa key using Apps](../assets/private-network-apps-insert-key.png)

```
keytype: gran
suri: <your mnemonic phrase> (eg. clip organ olive upper oak void inject side suit toilet stick narrow)
publicKey: <your raw ed25519 key> (eg. 0xb48004c6e1625282313b07d1c9950935e86894a2e4f21fb1ffee9854d180c781)
```

> If you generated your keys with the Apps UI you will not know your raw public key. In this case
> you may use your SS58 address (`5G9NWJ5P9uk7am24yCKeLZJqXWW6hjuMyRJDmw4ofqxG8Js2`) instead.

> If you are following these steps for the _second_ node in the network, you must connect the UI to
> the second node before inserting the keys.

### Option 2: Using CLI

You can also insert a key to the keystore by command line.

```bash
# Submit a new key via RPC, connect to where your `rpc-port` is listening
$ curl http://localhost:9933 -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"author_insertKey",
    "params": [
      "<aura/gran>",
      "<mnemonic phrase>",
      "<public key>"
    ]
  }'
```

If you enter the command and parameters correctly, the node will return a JSON response as follows.

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": null, "id": 1 }
```

## Subsequent Participants Join

Subsequent validators can now join the network. This can be done by specifying the `--bootnodes`
paramter as Bob did previously.

```bash
./target/release/node-template \
  --base-path /tmp/node02 \
  --chain ./customSpecRaw.json \
  --port 30334 \
  --ws-port 9945 \
  --rpc-port 9934 \
  --telemetry-url 'ws://telemetry.polkadot.io:1024 0' \
  --validator \
  --name MyNode02 \
  --bootnodes /ip4/<IP Address>/tcp/<Port>/p2p/<Peer ID>
```

As before, we specify another `base-path`, give it another `name`, and also specify this node as a
`validator`.

Once the node is up, you're ready to add keys to its keystore by following the process (in the
previous section) just like you did for the first node.

> If you're inserting keys with the UI, you must connect the UI to the second node's WebSocket
> endpoint before inserting the second node's keys.

> Reminder: All validators must be using identical chain specifications in order to peer. You should
> see the same genesis block and state root hashes.

Once both nodes have their keys, you should see them authoring

```

This line shows that your node has peered with another (**`1 peers`**), and they have produced a
block (**`best: #1 (0x5987‚Ä¶be47)`**).

You may notice that no block finalization has happened yet (**`finalized #0 (0xf437‚Ä¶e7fe)`**).
Substrate nodes require a restart after inserting a grandpa key. Kill your nodes and restart them
with the same commands you used previously. Now blocks should be finalized.

## You're Finished

Congratulations! You've started your own blockchain!

In this tutorial you've learned to generate your own keypairs, create a custom chain spec that uses
those keypairs, and start a private network based on your custom chain spec.
