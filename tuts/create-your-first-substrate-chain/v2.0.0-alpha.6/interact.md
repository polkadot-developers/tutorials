title: Interacting with Your Node
---

Now that your node has finished compiling, let's show you how everything works out of the box.

## Starting Your Node

Run the following commands to start your node:

```bash
# Purge chain cleans up any old data from running a `dev` node in the past
# You will be prompted to type `y`
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev

# Run your actual node in "development" mode
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

You should see something like this if your node is running successfully:

```
$ ./target/release/node-template --dev

If the number after `best:` is increasing, your blockchain is producing new blocks!

## Start the Front End

To interact with the local node we will use the Polkadot-js Apps user interface, often known as
"Apps" for short. Despite the name, Apps will work with any Substrate-based blockchain including
ours, not just Polkadot.

In your web browser, navigate to
[https://polkadot.js.org/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/settings?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9944).

On the `Settings` tab ensure that you are connected to a `Local Node` or `ws://127.0.0.1:9944`.

> Some browsers, notably Firefox, will not connect to a local node from an https website. An easy
> work around is to try another browser, like Chromium. Another option is to
> [host this interface locally](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps#development).

## Interact

Select the **Accounts** tab, you will see test accounts that you have access to. Some, like Alice
and Bob, already have funds!

![Apps UI with pre-funded accounts](../assets/apps-prefunded.png)

You can try to transfer some funds from Alice to Charlie by clicking the "send" button.

![Balance Transfer](../assets/apps-transfer.png)

If everything went successfully, you should see some popup notifications claiming "Extrinsic
Success", and of course Charlie's balance will increase.

## Create Your Own Account

You can create your own account by selecting the `+ Add Account` button. It won't have any tokens
yet, but you can send some from Alice or any other pre-funded account. Only you (and your browser)
will know the private key for your own account which means nobody can transfer those tokens except
you.

## Next Steps

This is the end of your journey to launching your first blockchain with Substrate.

You have launched a working Substrate-based blockchain, attached a user interface to that chain, and
made token transfers among users. We hope you'll continue learning about Substrate.

Your next step may be:

- Decentralize your network with more nodes in the
  [Start a Private Network](/tutorials/start-a-private-network/v2.0.0-alpha.6) tutorial.
- Add custom functionality in the [Build a dApp](/tutorials/build-a-dapp/v2.0.0-alpha.6) tutorial.

If you experienced any issues with this tutorial or want to provide feedback, feel free to
[open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/tutorials/issues/new) or reach out
on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!HzySYSaIhtyWrwiwEV:matrix.org).
